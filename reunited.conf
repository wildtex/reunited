#
# The reunited configuration file (reunited).
#
# "reunited" takes package structured split source code and re-unites it back
# into application visible locations on the host system (e.g. webroot location)
#

## Monitored source files:
#   /<workspace>/<project>/.../<target directory patterns>
# Default workspace - override when starting daemon with -w | --workspace
# workspace = /home/myusername/Workspace

## Default project being edited - override with -p | --project
# project = MyProjectName

## Logging preferences
# logging-enabled = true
# logging-level = all|sync-only|none
# logfile = /var/log/reunited.log

## Advanced preferences
# Some editors use "atomic save" like Sublime Text which creates a temp file
# and replaces the file being saved with the temp file. If "atomic save" is
# disabled nothing needs to be changed.  Otherwise, you can configure the
# "ignore-patterns" preference below with 1 or more (comma delimited) file 
# patterns to ignore to match the atomic temp files
# ignore-patterns = *.tmp

## Define target directory patterns to replicate (multiples accepted)
# owner/group is for target transformation
# 
# [/var/www/mywebsite]
# owner = <destination owner | empty for source owner>
# group = <destination group | empty for source group>
# permissions = <nnnn | empty for source permissions>
# ignore-hidden = <true | false (default false)>
# ignore-directories = <comma delimited directory list>
# ignore-files = <comma delimited file list>
# ...
